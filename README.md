# Python Machine Learning Project
## Overview
This project is designed to build and deploy machine learning models in Python. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment, following a structured and scalable framework for machine learning projects.

## Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Training and fine-tuning machine learning models
- Model evaluation and validation
- Deployment-ready scripts for production
- Integration of CI/CD pipelines for automated workflows
- Modular project structure for scalability

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`
    - `flask`
    - `pytest`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd projectdata
     ```
2. Execute the preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python src/preprocess.py
     ```
3. Train the machine learning model:
     ```bash
     python src/train.py
     ```
4. Launch the Flask application for deployment:
     ```bash
     python src/app.py
     ```

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment. Ensure the `.github/workflows` directory contains the necessary configuration files.
